                While there are some who genuinely cast their vote, 
                many people sit back and relax on voting day, and others 
                are cajoled into voting for particular candidates. 
                The importance of voting is lost amongst the hustle 
                and bustle of city life. While everyone sits and complains 
                about this and that, and makes suggestions that the government 
                should change this and that, the elections come and go without 
                half the population paying attention. The highest recorded voter 
                turnout in India was recorded in 2014 for the Lok Sabha elections 
                at 66.4%. That means close to half the population does not exercise 
                their <a href="info.php">right to vote</a>.</p>
                <p class="para">After 69 years of Independence, 
                India has not proved itself to have control and order. The fault 
                lies with both the leaders and the people. People are driven by
                religious beliefs rather than what is good for the country. 
                We should choose that which drives the country forward, while 
                still upholding the Indian tradition. But politics is wound up 
                in frivolous matters rather than paying more attention to uplifting 
                the poor, helping the aged, education, water, preserving the 
                environment, agriculture, roads, planned urban development, and so on.
